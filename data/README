The Planet Earth icon was chosen due to a few references:

* It represents International Doom as part of CRL, a project built with efforts 
  and contributions from people all over the world.
* It also references the ReMooD source port icon (a red planet), 
  which, like the original Chocorenderlimits, was created by RestlessRodent.
