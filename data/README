CRL icons are based on a Globe and Setting images from Vectors Market:
* https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/globe_744480
* https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/settings_757129

Planet Earth icon was choosen because of few references:

* As a reference to the International Doom that is the CRL, it was created
  with efforts and bits of code from people all over the world.
* As a reference to the ReMooD source port icon (red planet),
  which was like the original Chocorenderlimits created by RestlessRodent.
