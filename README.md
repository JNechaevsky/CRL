# CRL

CRL is a continuation of [Chocorenderlimits](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Chocorenderlimits) source port created by [RestlessRodent](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/RestlessRodent).

Armed with new features, QoL and technical improvements, it provides the ability to assist mappers in creating vanilla-compatible maps, as well as checking some specific scenarios via additional in-game modes. The grave/tilde **[~]** key opens the in-game menu which can be used to change the settings and features.

The main idea is still the same: this is a crash-prone source port that prints in-game warnings instead of crashes. However, no changes have been made to the drawing code, and important bugs like Tutti-Frutti and Medusa are still there to preserve DOS executable behavior and look. Medusa is no longer critical, however, and does not crash Windows executables. For vanilla-compatibility purposes, despite of being crash-prone in complex game scenes, this is not limit-removing source port and it will not be able to load huge maps.

Important bits of code has been ported from [International Doom](https://github.com/jnechaevsky/inter-doom), [Crispy Doom](http://github.com/fabiangreffrath/crispy-doom) and [DOOM Retro](https://github.com/bradharding/doomretro).
